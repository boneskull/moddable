<h1>Getting Started with Moddable Three</h1>
<p>Copyright 2019 Moddable Tech, Inc.<BR>
Revised: May 17, 2019</p>
<p>This document describes how to start building Moddable applications for Moddable Three. It provides information on how to configure the host build environment and how to build and deploy apps. It also provides information about development resources, including a summary of the examples available in this repository that run on Moddable Three.</p>

<h2>About Moddable Three</h2>
<img src="../assets/devices/moddable-three.png">
<p>Moddable Three is a hardware module that makes it easy for developers to experiment with the Moddable SDK on inexpensive hardware. It is available to purchase on the <a href="http://www.moddable.com/moddable-three">Moddable website</a>.</p>
<p><a id="components"></a></p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>The two main components of Moddable Three are the ESP8266 module and ePaper screen. The ESP8266 module includes a Wi-Fi antenna and 4 MB of flash storage memory. The ePaper screen is a 122 x 250 black and white display.</p>
<p><a id="setup"></a></p>
<h2>SDK and Host Environment Setup</h2>
<p>The <a href="../Moddable_SDK_-_Getting_Started.html">Moddable SDK Getting Started document</a> describes how to configure the host build environment and install the required SDKs, drivers, and development tools. Follow the instructions in the <strong>Host environment setup</strong> and <strong>ESP8266 setup</strong> sections for your computer's operating system.</p>
<p><a id="building-and-deploying-apps"></a></p>
<h2>Building and Deploying Apps</h2>
<p>After you've set up your host environment, take the following steps to install an application on your Moddable Three.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attach your Moddable Three to your computer with a micro USB cable.</p>
<p>Make sure you're using a data syncâ€“capable cable, not one that is power-only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build and deploy the app with <code>mcconfig</code>.</p>
<p><code>mcconfig</code> is the command line tool to build and launch Moddable apps on microcontrollers and the simulator. Full documentation of <code>mcconfig</code> is available <a href="../tools/tools.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Use the platform <code>-p esp/moddable_three</code>  with <code>mcconfig</code> to build for Moddable Three. For example, to build the <a href="../../examples/piu/love-e-ink"><code>piu/love-e-ink</code> example</a>:</p>
<pre><code>cd $MODDABLE/examples/piu/love-e-ink
mcconfig -d -m -p esp/moddable_three
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="../../examples">examples readme</a> contains additional information about other commonly used <code>mcconfig</code> arguments for screen rotation, Wi-Fi configuration, and more.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Development Resources</h2>
<p><a id="examples"></a></p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The Moddable SDK has over 150 <a href="../../examples">example apps</a> that demonstrate how to use its many features. Most of these examples run on Moddable Three.</p>
<p>That said, many of the examples that use Commodetto and Piu are designed for colored screens with a faster refresh rate. In addition, not every example is compatible with Moddable Three hardware. For example, the ESP8266 does not have BLE capabilities so BLE examples do not build or run. Some examples are designed to test specific display and touch drivers that are not compatible with the Moddable Three display and give a build error.</p>
<p><a id="documentation"></a></p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>All the documentation for the Moddable SDK is in the <a href="../">documentation</a> directory. The <strong>documentation</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, and <strong>modules</strong> directories share a common structure to make it straightforward to locate information. Some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>commodetto</code> subdirectory, which contains resources related to Commodetto--a bitmap graphics library that provides a 2D graphics API--and Poco, a lightweight rendering engine.</li>
<li>The <code>piu</code> subdirectory, which contains resources related to Piu, a user interface framework that makes it easier to create complex, responsive layouts.</li>
<li>The <code>networking</code> subdirectory, which contains networking resources related to network sockets and a variety of standard, secure networking protocols built on sockets including HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, DNS, SNTP, and telnet</li>
<li>The <code>pins</code> subdirectory, which contains resources related to supported hardware protocols (digital, analog, PWM, I2C, etc.). A number of drivers for common off-the-shelf sensors and corresponding example apps are also available.</li>
</ul>
